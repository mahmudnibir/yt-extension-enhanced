## Coding Guidelines

- Keep code **modular and readable** — one responsibility per function.
- Use **descriptive variable and function names**.
- **Comment complex logic**; add JSDoc for public functions.
- Validate inputs and handle edge cases and API errors.
- Follow existing code style — no external linter is configured, but match the surrounding style closely.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Create a branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Commit with a conventional message:
   ```
   feat(overlay): add double-click to reset speed
   fix(content): prevent ad-skip loop on live streams
   ```
3. Open a PR against `main` with a clear description of what changed and why.
4. Ensure there are no console errors when the extension loads.
